## Overview
This application's purpose is to analyze data from a survey sent to members of the [Behavior Analyst Certification Board](https://www.bacb.com/).

The application was tested using Python 3.6.6 running on Ubuntu and relies on:
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## How it works

1. Question 1: Descriptive statistics of survey results
2. Question 2: Are there significant differences between the averages of reported frequency of individual supervisor behaviors relative to other individual supervisor behaviors?
3. Question 3: Are there significant differences between frequency of  individual supervisor behaviors relative to supervisor demographics?
